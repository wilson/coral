# What is Coral?

Coral is an interpreted object-oriented programming language designed to help programmers experience joy.  
It inherits many (hopefully) lovely multi-paradigm ideas from its many spiritual ancestors, especially Perl, Smalltalk, and Lisp.

## Features of Coral

* Simple Syntax
* **Normal** Object-oriented Features (e.g. class, method calls)
* **Advanced** Object-oriented Features (e.g. mix-in, singleton-method)
* Operator Overloading
* Exception Handling
* Iterators and Closures
* Garbage Collection
* Dynamic Loading of Object Files (on some architectures)
* Highly Portable (works on many Unix-like/POSIX compatible platforms as
  well as Windows, macOS, etc.)
